# GoogleCodeJam

This is my attempt to solve the
[Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/) problems in
Haskell. I will only publish attempts for past rounds, and as I am
learning the language, I will probably revisit and readjust the files
until they (kind of) work. They are by no means guaranteed to be the
solutions that I submitted during the contest.
